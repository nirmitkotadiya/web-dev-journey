# **Day 7: HTML Text ðŸ“„**  

Understanding text elements in HTML is crucial for structuring content properly.  

## ðŸ“Œ **Headings in HTML**  
HTML provides six levels of headings, ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.  
- `<h1>` is the **largest** and most important heading.  
- `<h6>` is the **smallest** heading.  
- Headings help structure your content and improve readability.  

### âœ¨ Example:
```html
<h1>This is Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is Heading 6</h6>
```
