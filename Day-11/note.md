# 🚀 **Day 11: Self-Closing Tags**

## 📌 What are Self-Closing Tags?

In HTML, tags can be categorized into two types:

### **1️⃣ Normal Tags**

These tags have both an **opening** and a **closing** tag.

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### **2️⃣ Self-Closing Tags**

Self-closing tags **do not require a closing tag** as they don’t wrap content.

✅ Examples:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
<br>
<hr>
```

🔹 **Key Points:**

- Self-closing tags **end within the opening tag itself**.
- They are commonly used for elements that **don’t need to enclose content**.
- In **XHTML** or **XML**, a forward slash (`/`) is added before closing:
  ```html
  <br />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image" />
  ```
  _(This is optional in modern HTML5)_
