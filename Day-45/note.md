# 🚀 Day 45: CSS Units + Responsiveness

Understanding CSS units is key to creating scalable, responsive layouts. Today, we explore **absolute** and **relative** units and how they impact your design's adaptability across devices.

## 📏 Types of CSS Units

### ✅ Absolute Units

Absolute units are fixed and do **not scale** based on the screen size or user settings.

| Unit | Description     | Example  |
|------|------------------|----------|
| px   | Pixels           | `font-size: 16px` |
| cm   | Centimeters      | `width: 10cm`     |
| mm   | Millimeters      | `height: 5mm`     |
| in   | Inches           | `padding: 1in`    |
| pt   | Points (1/72 in) | `font-size: 12pt` |
| pc   | Picas (12pt)     | `margin: 2pc`     |

> 📌 **Use absolute units sparingly.** They are useful in print layouts or fixed elements but not ideal for web responsiveness.

### 🔁 Relative Units

Relative units scale based on context—either the parent element or the root font size—making them perfect for responsive design.

| Unit  | Based On              | Example |
|-------|------------------------|---------|
| %     | Parent element         | `width: 50%` |
| em    | Parent font-size       | `font-size: 2em` |
| rem   | Root font-size         | `font-size: 1.5rem` |
| vw    | Viewport width         | `width: 80vw` |
| vh    | Viewport height        | `height: 90vh` |
| vmin  | Smaller of vw/vh       | `width: 50vmin` |
| vmax  | Larger of vw/vh        | `height: 100vmax` |

> 📱 **Preferred for responsive design**. Combine `rem`, `%`, `vw`, and `vh` to build fluid layouts.

## 🧪 Quick Demo

```css
html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container {
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 1000px;
  padding: 2rem;
}

.heading {
  font-size: 2rem; /* 32px if root is 16px */
}
```

## 🌐 Responsive Best Practices

- Use `rem` for consistent typography
- Use `%` or `vw/vh` for layout widths/heights
- Combine `max-width` with `width: 100%` for responsive images
- Avoid mixing absolute units with responsive layouts
