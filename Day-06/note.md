# **Day 6: HTML Structure 📄**

Understanding the **structure of an HTML document** is essential for web development. Let's explore the key elements that make up an HTML page.

## **🌟 HTML Structure Overview**

### 1️⃣ **Document Type (`<!DOCTYPE html>`)**
- Defines the version of HTML being used.
- Required at the beginning of every HTML document.

### 2️⃣ **HTML Tag (`<html>...</html>`)**
- The root element that wraps the entire web page content.

### 3️⃣ **Head Tag (`<head>...</head>`)**
- Contains meta-information about the document, such as:
  - **Metadata (`<meta>`)** - Provides information about the page (e.g., character encoding, viewport settings).
  - **Title (`<title>...</title>`)** - Sets the title of the document (visible in the browser tab).
  - **Links & Scripts** - References external CSS files and JavaScript.

### 4️⃣ **Body Tag (`<body>...</body>`)**
- Holds the main content of the webpage, including:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Links
  - Buttons
  - Other elements displayed on the page.
