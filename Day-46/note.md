# 🚀 Day 46: Rem

The `rem` unit in CSS stands for **"root em"**—a relative unit that scales based on the **root element’s (`<html>`) font size**. It’s ideal for creating responsive and consistent designs.

## 📐 What is 1rem?

By default:
- `1rem = 16px` (because most browsers set `html { font-size: 16px; }`)

You can customize it:
```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%; /* 62.5% of 16px = 10px */
}
```
Now:
- `1rem = 10px`
- `1.6rem = 16px`
- `2rem = 20px`

## ✅ Benefits of rem

- ✅ Scales based on root font-size
- ✅ Easy to maintain consistent spacing and typography
- ✅ More predictable than `em` (which depends on the parent’s font size)
- ✅ Great for responsive design

## 🧪 Example

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

p {
  font-size: 1.6rem; /* 16px */
  padding: 1rem;     /* 10px */
}
```

```html
<p>
  This paragraph uses rem-based font-size and padding.
</p>
```
