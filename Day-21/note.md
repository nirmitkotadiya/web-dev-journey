# 🚀 Day 21: Ways to Add CSS :

## 📌 Overview
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style web pages and enhance their appearance. There are three primary ways to add CSS to your HTML documents: **Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS.** Each method has its advantages and use cases.

## 🎨 Ways to Add CSS

### 1️⃣ **Inline CSS**
Inline CSS is applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute.

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">This is a paragraph with inline CSS.</p>
```

✅ **Pros:**
- Quick and easy for small changes.
- No need for an external file.

❌ **Cons:**
- Difficult to manage for large projects.
- Reduces readability and maintainability.

### 2️⃣ **Internal CSS**
Internal CSS is defined within the `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` section of an HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: green;
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This paragraph is styled using internal CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

✅ **Pros:**
- Useful for styling a single document.
- No need for an additional CSS file.

❌ **Cons:**
- Not reusable across multiple pages.
- Can increase page load time if overused.

### 3️⃣ **External CSS**
External CSS is written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag.

```css
/* styles.css */
p {
    color: red;
    font-size: 22px;
}
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p>This paragraph is styled using external CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

✅ **Pros:**
- Best for large projects.
- Allows better separation of concerns.
- Enhances maintainability and scalability.

❌ **Cons:**
- Requires an additional file request.
- Not ideal for small, single-page projects.

---

## 🌟 **Best Practices**
- Use **External CSS** for better organization and maintainability.
- Avoid **Inline CSS** unless necessary for quick fixes.
- Use **Internal CSS** only when working on a single HTML page.
- Keep CSS files optimized and minified for faster performance.
- Use classes instead of inline styles for better reusability.
