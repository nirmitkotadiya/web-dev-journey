# **Day 2: How the Web Works 🌐**  

Understanding how the web functions is essential for every developer. Today, we’ll explore the **Client-Server Model** and the **Request-Response Cycle**—the backbone of web communication.  

---

## **📌 Client-Server Model**  

The web operates on a **client-server architecture**, where the **client** (user’s device) makes requests, and the **server** processes them and sends back a response.  

### 🔹 **Client (Front-end)**
This is the consumer of the service — any device or software making a request.  
📌 *Example:* Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox), Mobile App, etc.  

#### **Client Focus:**  
✅ Displaying Data  
✅ User Interaction (Forms, Clicks, etc.)  

---

### 🔹 **Server (Back-end)**  
This is the provider of the service. It listens for requests from the client and returns a response.  

#### **Server Responsibilities:**  
✅ Store Data 📂  
✅ Setup Rules 🔧  
✅ Serve Data 📡

## **🔄 Request-Response Cycle**  

Every time you type a website URL in your browser, a request is sent to the server, and the server responds with the requested web page.  

### **📍 Basic Flow:**  
➡️ **Client (Browser)** → Sends a Request → **Server**  
⬅️ **Server** → Processes the Request → Sends a Response → **Client (Browser)**
