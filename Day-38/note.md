# ğŸš€ Day 38: Box Sizing in CSS

## ğŸ“¦ Understanding `box-sizing`

In CSS, the `box-sizing` property defines how the total width and height of an element are calculated.

---

## âœ… Default: `content-box`

- Element size: `500px Ã— 300px`
- Padding: `10px`
- Border: `10px`

### ğŸ§  Total Rendered Size

```plaintext
Width: 500 + 10(left) + 10(right) + 10(border-left) + 10(border-right) = 540px
Height: 300 + 10(top) + 10(bottom) + 10(border-top) + 10(border-bottom) = 340px
```

> With `content-box`, width and height include **only** the content. Padding and border are **added outside** the specified dimensions.

---

## âœ… Alternative: `border-box`

- Element size: `500px Ã— 300px`
- Padding: `10px`
- Border: `10px`

### ğŸ§  Total Rendered Size

```plaintext
Width: 500px (includes content + padding + border)
Height: 300px (includes content + padding + border)
```

> With `border-box`, width and height include **content + padding + border**. It's easier to manage layout this way.
