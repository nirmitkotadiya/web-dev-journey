# 🚀 Day 77: JavaScript Day-21 - JavaScript For Loop

## 📌 What You’ll Learn

- 🔁 How the `for` loop works in JavaScript
- 🔄 Looping from lower to higher values
- 🔃 Looping in reverse (countdown)
- 🧠 Loop structure and syntax

---

## 🔍 Description

### ✅ Forward Loop

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Prints 0 to 5
}
```

### 🔁 Reverse Loop

```javascript
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
  console.log(i); // Prints 10 to 1
}
```

Both loops are printed to the browser console, showcasing how iterations work with incrementing and decrementing values.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- `for` loops are ideal when the number of iterations is known in advance.
- Consist of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
- They help avoid code repetition and make logic concise.

---

## 🚀 Stay Curious

Looping is foundational in programming. Continue experimenting with:

- Nested loops
- Looping through arrays or objects
- Combining loops with conditionals
