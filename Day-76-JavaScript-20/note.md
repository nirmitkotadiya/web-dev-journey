# 🚀 Day 76: JavaScript Day-20 - JavaScript While Loop

This project demonstrates the use of the **`while` loop** in JavaScript—an essential control structure that allows repetitive execution of code as long as a condition is true. This project is part of a daily coding series focused on mastering core JavaScript concepts through hands-on practice.

---

## 📌 What This Project Covers

- ✅ Understanding the `while` loop
- 🔁 Repeating code execution based on a condition
- 📟 Logging values to the console for real-time output

---

## 🔍 How It Works

In this project:

- A `while` loop is used to print numbers from `0` to `5`.
- A counter variable `i` is initialized to `0`.
- The loop continues to execute as long as `i <= 5`.
- Each iteration increments `i` by `1` and prints the value to the browser's console.

---

## 📜 Code Snippet

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- The `while` loop checks the condition **before** executing the code block.
- Great for situations where you don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run.
- Always make sure the condition eventually becomes false to avoid an infinite loop.
