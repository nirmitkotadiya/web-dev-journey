## 🔍 Code Highlights

```css
.parent {
  background-color: aqua;
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px; /* Adds spacing between flex items */
}

.one,
.two,
.three {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

The `gap` property simplifies layout spacing—no need for adding margins to child elements. Cleaner, more readable, and responsive-friendly!
