# 🚀 Day 22: Semantic HTML

## 📌 Overview
Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that convey meaning about their content, improving accessibility, SEO, and code readability. Unlike non-semantic elements (`<div>`, `<span>`), semantic elements provide better structure and context to web pages.

## 🎯 **Advantages of Semantic HTML**

✅ **Improves Accessibility** – Helps screen readers interpret content correctly.  
✅ **Boosts SEO** – Search engines understand content better, improving ranking.  
✅ **Enhances Readability** – Clean and structured code makes maintenance easier.

## 🔍 **Non-Semantic vs. Semantic HTML**

### ❌ Non-Semantic HTML:
```html
<div>
    <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
```
- No meaningful structure.
- Does not describe the purpose of content.

### ✅ Semantic HTML:
```html
<header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
<main>
    <section>
        <article>
            <h2>Article Title</h2>
            <p>This is a meaningful article.</p>
        </article>
    </section>
</main>
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
</footer>
```

✅ Uses elements that describe their purpose.
✅ Provides better structure for users and search engines.
