# 🚀 Day 73: JavaScript Day-17 - JavaScript Window Object

Today's task focuses on exploring the **JavaScript `window` object**, which is the global object in the browser environment. This project demonstrates how common functions like `console.log()` and `alert()` are actually properties of the `window` object.

---

## 📚 Key Concepts

- The `window` object is the **global scope** in client-side JavaScript.
- All global variables, functions, and objects are members of the `window` object.
- Common methods such as `console.log()` and `alert()` are accessed via `window`.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Using `console.log()` and `window.console.log()`
- Understanding `alert()` and `window.alert()`
- Recognizing that omitting `window.` is shorthand — both are functionally identical

## 💻 Code Snippet

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Day 73: JavaScript Day-17 - Window Object</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      // Both console.log and window.console.log do the same
      console.log("Hello from console.log");
      window.console.log("Hello from window.console.log");

      // Both alert and window.alert do the same
      alert("Hello from alert");
      window.alert("Hello from window.alert");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 🌐 Understanding the `window` Object

- `window.console.log()` is the same as `console.log()`.
- `window.alert()` is the same as `alert()`.
- The browser automatically attaches global methods to the `window` object.
- Using `window` explicitly can help you understand **scope** and the **global execution context**.

---

## 📌 Use Cases

- Accessing and manipulating browser-level information (like `window.location`, `window.history`)
- Setting global variables or timers (`window.setTimeout`, `window.setInterval`)
- Interacting with the DOM (`window.document`)

---

### ⚠️ Note

Avoid polluting the global `window` object with unnecessary variables — it can lead to unexpected conflicts in large applications.
