# 🚀 Day 88: JavaScript Day-32 - Git vs GitHub 💪

## 🔧 Git

- **Git** is a **Version Control System (VCS)**
- Helps you track changes in your **local codebase (repository)**
- Enables you to manage different versions of your code
- Essential for collaboration and maintaining code history

### Common Git Commands:

```bash
git init                                 # Initialize a new Git repository
git config --global user.name "Your Name"    # Set your Git username
git config --global user.email "you@example.com" # Set your Git email
```

## ☁️ GitHub

- **GitHub** is a **cloud platform** for hosting and sharing Git repositories
- Lets you collaborate with other developers and teams
- Great for open-source projects and team versioning
- Git + GitHub = 🔥 power tools for modern development
